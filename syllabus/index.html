<!-- l. 10 --><p class='noindent'>Tecnologías Multimedia (TM) is an optative subject of the Computer Science
Degree at the UAL (University of Almería).

<!-- l. 19 --><p class='noindent'>TM is focused on the development of real-time audio processing techniques,
specifically, encoding and transmission.

</p>
   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>5   </span> <a id='x1-50005'></a>Methodology and Contents</h3>
<!-- l. 38 --><p class='noindent'>TM follows the PBL (Project-Based Learning) <a href='http://portafirma.ual.es/pfirma/downloadReport/file?idDocument=4u61Ie5es2&amp;idRequest=ZeBY35LlFa'>methodology</a>. The students,
helped by the lecturer, develop a project during the classes. This project is
<a href='https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom'>InterCom</a>(municator), a Python application that allows networked users to
communicate, in real-time, throught the Internet.
</p><!-- l. 46 --><p class='indent'>   The project is developed as a sequence of milestones. The students, in groups of
up to 4 people, propose solutions for each milestone. Such solutions are presented to
the rest of the class, and each group gives and receives a feedback from the rest of the
class and also from the lecturer. The best solutions are incorporated to the project,
with the objective of improve it.
</p><!-- l. 53 --><p class='indent'>   The contents of the subject can be found <a href='https://tecnologias-multimedia.github.io/contents/'>here</a>.
</p><!-- l. 55 --><p class='noindent'>
</p>
   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>6   </span> <a id='x1-60006'></a>Attendance</h3>
<!-- l. 57 --><p class='noindent'>Currently, <a href='https://www.ual.es/estudios/grados/presentacion/plandeestudios/asignatura/4015/40154321'>the course is organized in 14 lectures of 2 hours/session, and 14 practicals
of 2 hours/session, during 7 weeks (approx.)</a>, and it has been developed to be a
virtual and blended training. This means that all the content is available online, but
students are expected to regularly attend the sessions, which are mainly
practical.
</p><!-- l. 65 --><p class='noindent'>
</p>
   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>7   </span> <a id='x1-70007'></a>Evaluation Criteria and Instruments</h3>
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!-- l. 67 --><p class='noindent'>TM is evaluated continuously, although there is the possibility of a single final
evaluation, which would be carried out on the day scheduled for the exam. The
continuous evaluation of the students is carried out from the work developed for each
one of the milestones that are presented in class.
</p><!-- l. 73 --><p class='indent'>   The course evaluation process is the responsibility of the teacher and follows the
following rules:
</p><!-- l. 76 --><p class='indent'>
     </p><ol class='enumerate1'>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-7002x1'>Sufficiently in advance, the teacher will propose a series of milestones
     associated with the project that is developed in the subject. The teacher,
     both during the master classes and in the practical classes, will give all
     the necessary information so that the students can develop the milestones.
     Generally, all milestones can be developed in parallel, although the order
     in which the milestones are completed is not fixed.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-7004x2'>The teacher will periodically receive information from the students about
     the degree of achievement of the milestones that are being developed, with
     the purpose of directing the development of the milestones. When the
     teacher sees fit, he will propose to the students that they present their
     solutions publicly (in class). Normally, the solutions should achieve 100%
     of the objectives set at each milestone.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-7006x3'>The grade that students will receive, for groups of up to 4 people, will
     depend on the order in which the solutions for the milestones have been
     reached. Specifically, the first group to achieve the milestone will receive
     the highest rating (10) and the rest of the groups, in temporal order of
     achievement of the milestone, will be rated with lower and lower grades,
     which will always be higher than 5 if the milestone has been properly
     developed.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-7008x4'>The groups that do not present any solution will receive a score of 0. The
     groups that have not approved following these rules will be qualified as
     "Not Presented".</li></ol>
