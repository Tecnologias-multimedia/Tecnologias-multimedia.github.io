## Evaluation

Students, working in groups of up to 4 people, are committed to submit **PRs** (Pull Requests) to a project hosted at GitHub, in order to get a score for passing the subject. This academic year, the project consists in the development of a [*Real-time Multimedia Intercom(unicator)*](https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom). 

Each PR must solve one of the **issues** defined in the project site, using the methodology described in the [*Fork and Branch Git Workflow Manua*l](https://github.com/vicente-gonzalez-ruiz/fork_and_branch_git_workflow). The issues will be fully defined on-the-fly, depending on the evolution of the project.

PRs can be generated only from GitHub accounts. Only accepted PRs will contribute to the score. At least one accepted PR will be needed to pass the subject.
