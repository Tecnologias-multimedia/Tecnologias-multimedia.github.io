NAT stands for Network Address Translation, and it is a method of
remapping an IP (Internet Protocol) address space into another by
modifying network address information in the IP header of packets
while they are in transit across a traffic routing device (see the
Fig~\ref{fig:NAT_framework}). When a network device on a internal
(usually private) network sends a packet P to the Internet, the NAT
device translates the internal IP address in the packet header to a
external (usually public) IP address. When a packet from the Internet
arrives at the NAT device, it translates the external IP address in
the packet header to the internal IP address of the device that sent
the packet P.

\section{Pros and cons}

NAT was designed because it provides the following advantages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It allows multiple devices on a private network to share a
  single public IP address and access the Internet. Therefore, a NAT
  device conserves public IP addresses, which are in short supply.
\item It can improve security by hiding the internal IP addresses of
  devices on the internal network.
\end{enumerate}

However, NAT also has (mainly) one disadvantage:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It can be difficult (and sometimes, impossible because NAT
  algorithms are not standarized) to host servers (for example, a Web
  server) on the internal network, because the incoming traffic will
  be filtered by the NAT device at least the server initiates the
  conections (something that by definition is not done by servers).
\end{enumerate}

\section{IP addresses, ports, end-points, connections, servers, clients and peers}

An IP address is a unique label that identifies a device on a
network. It is an integer number (32 bits in the case of IPv4 and 128
bits in IPv6) assigned to devices that use the Internet to
communicate. All IP packets have an IP address in their header. IPv4
addresses are usually written using the dotted-decimal notation, such
as for example, \texttt{10.20.30.40}. On the other hand, IPv6
addresses are expresed in colon-hexadecimal notation, such for
example, \texttt{2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334}.

A port in the context of networking is an integer number (usually 16
bits long) associated with a network protocol that receives or
transmits communication for a specific service (for example, port
\texttt{80} is used for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which
is used to transfer Web pages). Ports are used to identify a specific
service (usually running as a process) on a computer. When a computer
receives a packet of data, the operating system looks at the port
number in the packet header to determine which service should handle
the data.

An end-point is the combination of an IP address and a
port. End-points identify networked actors (usually computer
processes) that interchange IP packets. For example, the end-point
\texttt{8.8.8.8:53} identify a name-server provided by Google Inc. In
general, we will represent a end-point such as $A:b$, where $A$ is an
IP address and $b$ is a port.

A conection is the action of transmitting at least one packet from one
end-point to another. Notice that connections are determined by a pair
of end-points.

Networked actors can be classified in severs when they wait for the
requests from clients (clients always initiate the connections). When
the actors can act as servers and clients at the same time, they are
called peers.

\section{The Translation Table (TT)}

A NAT device uses a TT to track the connections that are established
between ``internal'' and ``external'' peers (see the
Fig.~\ref{fig:NAT_framework}). When an outgoing packet (generated in
the internal network) arrives, the TT registers the internal end-point
of the peer that has sent this packet. When an incoming packet
(generated in the external network) arrives, the TT indicates the
internal end-point of a peer.

Notice that the entries in the TT are only generated for outgoing
traffic. If happens that when an external IP packet arrives to the NAT
device and there is not any TT-entry associated to the connection, the
packet is discarded.

\section{Types of NAT}

\subsection{Static and dynamic}

Depending on the number of available IP external addresses:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A static NAT device maps a single internal IP address to a
  single external IP address. Static NAT devices are used in home
  networks.
\item A dynamic NAT device maps multiple internal IP addresses to a
  pool of external IP addresses. This is the most common type of NAT
  device and is used in most home and office networks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Types of ports mapping}

Depending on how the external ports are assigned:

\begin{enumerate}
\item EIM (Endpoint Independent Mapping) NAT devices reuse the same
  (external) port $P(X:y)$ for all traffic sent from the same internal
  end-point $X:y$ to any external endpoint. Therefore, it holds that
  \begin{equation}
    P(X:y)=y, \forall X,
  \end{equation}
  if $y$ is avaliable in the TT. If the external port $y$ is not
  available (because there is another host in the internal network
  that is using the same port $y$), then the NAT device usually
  selects the ``next'' (counting from $y$) free port.  This algorithm
  is used in Cone NATs and Port-Preservation Symmetric NAT devices.
\item In CDM (Connection Dependent Mapping) NAT devices the assigned
  (external) port $P(X:x,Y:y)$ is different for each connection
  $(X:x,Y:y)$, where $X:x$ is an internal end-point and $Y:y$ is an
  external end-point. In this case, we can distinguish between:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Fixed-$\Delta$ CDM, if the NAT device selects $P(X:x,Y:y)$
    using a constant port step $\Delta$. $\Delta$ is a natural number.
    \item Random-$\Delta$ CDM, if the NAT device selects $P(X:x,Y:y)$
      using a random port step $\Delta$.
  \end{enumerate}
  These algorithms are used in symmetric NAT devices. Notice that,
  even if our device is fixed-$\Delta$, it could behave as a
  Random-$\Delta$ one due to the outgoing traffic generated by
  neighbor peers.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Types of packet filtering}

Depending on how the incoming traffic is accepted (or not), NAT are
classified as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item EIF (Endpoint Independent Filtering) when the incoming packets
  are forwarded without any extra restriction. This is used in Full
  Cone NAT devices.
\item ARF (Address Restricted Filtering) when only those incoming
  packets having the same external IP address as the one in the
  TT-entry is forwarded to the internal end-point. This policy is used
  by Restricted Cone NAT devices.
\item ERF (Endpoint Restricted Filtering) when only external incoming
  packets having the same external end-point like the one in the
  TT-entry is forwarded to the internal end-point. This policy is used
  in Port Restricted Cone (PRCN) and Symmetric NAT devices.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Custom-server assisted UDP hole punching}

UDP hole punching is a technique for transmitting UDP packets between
peers that are behind different NAT devices, ... in some
cases.\footnote{It is not always reliable, and it may not work in all
  situations.} UDP hole punching works by having the two peers first
send messages to each other through a third-party server. After that,
the peers try to ``punch a hole'' in theirs NAT devices through which
the incoming traffic can cross the NAT device.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{graphics/UDP_Hole_Punching_RCN}
  \caption{A sucessful UDP ``connection'' between two peers $P_1$ and
    $P_2$. $a$, $b$, and $s$ represent the external port assigned by
    NAT device $A$ for the outgoing traffic from $P_1$, $b$ is exactly
    the same, but for NAT device $B$, and $s$ is the public port used
    by the server $S$.}
  \label{fig:UHP}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:UHP} shows an example where two ``NAT-ed'' peers $P_1$
and $P_2$, establish an UDP connection, with the help of a server
$S$. As it can be seen, the peers talk to the server first and then,
between them. In the Step 15, $P_1$ knows that it can communicate with
$P_2$, and in the Step 19, $P_2$ recongnizes successful ``connection''
with $P_1$.

\section{STUN-sever assisted UDP hole punching}

STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) is a standard network
protocol, defined in the RFC (Request for Comments) 5389, designed to
provide public IP address and port discovery when UDP is used. There
are dozens of STUN servers available that can be consulted. Some of
them are (most STUN severs are listening to the port 3478):
\begin{verbatim}
stun.l.google.com:3478
stun.12connect.com:3478
stun.12voip.com:3478
\end{verbatim}
See also \url{https://gist.github.com/mondain/b0ec1cf5f60ae726202e}.

In Python, you can query a server with:
\begin{verbatim}
import stun # Install with "pip install pystun3"
nat_type, external_ip, external_port = stun.get_ip_info(stun_host='stun.l.google.com')
\end{verbatim}

Notice that STUN servers do not provide information about other
peers. Therefore, you need to specify (manually) the end-point of your
interlocutor when using InterCom, before the UDP hole punching
maneuver.

\section{Port-forwarding}

It is possible to ``open by hand'' external ports in your NAT device
if you have administrator privileges. To do this, you need to login
into your NAT device and configure an UDP connection which should
indicate an external (unused) port and the internal end-point where
InterCom is listening to.

\section{Deliverables}

A Python module called \texttt{NAT\_traversal.py} that inherits from
\texttt{minimal.py} and that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the external (public) IP address of the NAT device that you are
  using. Determine also the external port assigned by the NAT device.
\item Implement the UDP hole punching, at least, in one port. Notice
  that the traffic generated by InterCom could be enough in this case.
\end{enumerate}
