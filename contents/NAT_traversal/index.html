<!-- l. 21 --><p class='indent'>   NAT stands for Network Address Translation, and it is a method of remapping an
IP (Internet Protocol) address space into another by modifying network address
information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic
routing device (see the Fig <a href='#x1-1001r1'>1<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:NAT_framework  --></a>). When a network device on a internal (usually private)
network sends a packet P to the Internet, the NAT device translates the internal IP
address in the packet header to a external (usually public) IP address. When a packet
from the Internet arrives at the NAT device, it translates the external IP address in
the packet header to the internal IP address of the device that sent the packet
P.

   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>2   </span> <a id='x1-20002'></a>Pros and cons</h3>
<!-- l. 35 --><p class='noindent'>NAT was designed because it provides the following advantages:
     </p><ol class='enumerate1'>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-2002x1'>It allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP
     address and access the Internet. Therefore, a NAT device conserves public
     IP addresses, which are in short supply.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-2004x2'>It can improve security by hiding the internal IP addresses of devices on
     the internal network.</li></ol>
<!-- l. 44 --><p class='indent'>   However, NAT also has (mainly) one disadvantage:
     </p><ol class='enumerate1'>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-2006x1'>It can be difficult (and sometimes, impossible because NAT algorithms are
     not standarized) to host servers (for example, a Web server) on the internal
     network, because the incoming traffic will be filtered by the NAT device
     at least the server initiates the conections (something that by definition is
     not done by servers).</li></ol>
<!-- l. 53 --><p class='noindent'>
</p>
                                                                  

                                                                  
   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>3   </span> <a id='x1-30003'></a>IP addresses, ports, end-points, connections, servers, clients and
peers</h3>
<!-- l. 55 --><p class='noindent'>An IP address is a unique label that identifies a device on a network. It is an
integer number (32 bits in the case of IPv4 and 128 bits in IPv6) assigned
to devices that use the Internet to communicate. All IP packets have an
IP address in their header. IPv4 addresses are usually written using the
dotted-decimal notation, such as for example, <span class='ectt-1000'>10.20.30.40</span>. On the other hand, IPv6
addresses are expresed in colon-hexadecimal notation, such for example,
<span class='ectt-1000'>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</span>.
</p><!-- l. 64 --><p class='indent'>   A port in the context of networking is an integer number (usually 16 bits long)
associated with a network protocol that receives or transmits communication for a
specific service (for example, port <span class='ectt-1000'>80 </span>is used for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP), which is used to transfer Web pages). Ports are used to identify
a specific service (usually running as a process) on a computer. When a
computer receives a packet of data, the operating system looks at the port
number in the packet header to determine which service should handle the
data.
</p><!-- l. 74 --><p class='indent'>   An end-point is the combination of an IP address and a port. End-points identify
networked actors (usually computer processes) that interchange IP packets. For
example, the end-point <span class='ectt-1000'>8.8.8.8:53 </span>identify a name-server provided by Google Inc.
In general, we will represent a end-point such as \(A:b\), where \(A\) is an IP address and \(b\) is a
port.
</p><!-- l. 81 --><p class='indent'>   A conection is the action of transmitting at least one packet from one
end-point to another. Notice that connections are determined by a pair of
end-points.
</p><!-- l. 85 --><p class='indent'>   Networked actors can be classified in severs when they wait for the requests from
clients (clients always initiate the connections). When the actors can act as servers
and clients at the same time, they are called peers.
</p><!-- l. 90 --><p class='noindent'>
</p>
   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>4   </span> <a id='x1-40004'></a>The Translation Table (TT)</h3>
<!-- l. 92 --><p class='noindent'>A NAT device uses a TT to track the connections that are established between
“internal” and “external” peers (see the Fig. <a href='#x1-1001r1'>1<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:NAT_framework  --></a>). When an outgoing packet (generated
in the internal network) arrives, the TT registers the internal end-point of
the peer that has sent this packet. When an incoming packet (generated in
the external network) arrives, the TT indicates the internal end-point of a
peer.
</p><!-- l. 100 --><p class='indent'>   Notice that the entries in the TT are only generated for outgoing traffic. If
happens that when an external IP packet arrives to the NAT device and there is not
any TT-entry associated to the connection, the packet is discarded.

     endpoint. Therefore, it holds that \begin {equation}  P(X:y)=y, \forall X,  \end {equation}
     if \(y\) is avaliable in the TT. If the external port \(y\) is not available (because there is
     another host in the internal network that is using the same port \(y\)), then the
     NAT device usually selects the “next” (counting from \(y\)) free port. This
     algorithm is used in Cone NATs and Port-Preservation Symmetric NAT
     devices.

<!-- l. 174 --><p class='noindent'>UDP hole punching is a technique for transmitting UDP packets

UDP hole punching works by having the two peers first send messages to each other
through a third-party server. After that, the peers try to “punch a hole” in
theirs NAT devices through which the incoming traffic can cross the NAT
device.
