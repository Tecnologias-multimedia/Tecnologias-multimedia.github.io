\section{The dyadic frequency partition is not enough}

The number of subbands generated by the dyadic DWT decomposition
(remember, if $l$ is the number of levels of the DWT, we obtain $l+1$
subbands) is not enough to provide an efficient quantization in the
wavelet domain.

\section{Decomposition of the dyadic subbands}

A solution is to divide each one of the dyadic subbands into a number
of subbands. Thus, if we have $l+1$ dyadic subbands and now we
decompose each subband into $n$ (sub)subbands, we get a total number
of $n(l+1)$ subbands.

For this, we can use the DWT-packet (DWT-p) applied to each dyadic
subband generated by the DWT of the extended chunk (see Milestone
\emph{Redundancy Removal}). As it can be seen in that milestone, we
compute the transform of an extended current chunk to remove the
discontinuities at the border of the chunks. The idea here is to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Extend the chunk (this can be inherited from the class
  \verb|Temporal_Overlapped_DWT|).
\item Compute the dyadic DWT transform of the extended chunk (this can
  be also reused from the class \verb|Temporal_Overlapped_DWT|).
\item Compute the DWT-p of each dyadic (extended) subband. Let
  $\log_2(n)$ the number of levels of this transform.
\item Extract the central parts of each packet-subband to obtain a
  total number of coefficients that matches to the number of frames in
  the chunk.
\end{enumerate}
  
Notice that DWT-p performs a lineal partition. Therefore, for example,
if the sampling frequency is $48000$ Hz, $l=3$ and $\log_2(n)=2$ (the
number of levels of the DWT-p is one), the lowest frequency dyadic
subband goes from $0$ Hz to $3000=\frac{24000}{2^8}$ Hz, and it will de
divided into two subbands with a size (bandwidth) of $1500$ Hz.

\section{Dyadic-packet DWT subbands and quantization steps}

Similarly as we did in the Milestone \emph{Perceptual Coding
  Considering the Threshold of Hearing}, we have to find a total
number of $n(l+1)$ quantization step sizes that are proportional to
the area below the ToH curve corresponding to each dyadic-packet
subband.

\section{Deliverables}

Implement a Python module called \verb|more_subbands.py| where the
previously defined functionality has been implemented.
