\maketitle

\section{Description}

The InterCom project \cite{intercom} is written in Python
\cite{Python}. You will need to understand the syntax and how to
develop/run Python programs
(\href{https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#modules}{modules}
and
\href{https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages}{packages}).

\section{What you have to do?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item You don't need to master Python to follow this course, but it is
  convenient for you to follow a tutorial, such as The Python
  Tutorial \cite{python-tutorial} if you realize that the language is
  a setback for you. If you need to start with Python from scratch,
  a \href{https://github.com/vicente-gonzalez-ruiz/YAPT/tree/master/workshops/programacion_python_ESO}{workshop} \cite{YAPT}
  like this could be interesting.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Timming}

your own pace.

\section{Deliverables}
