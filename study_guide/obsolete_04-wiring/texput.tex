\title{\TM{} - Study Guide - Milestone 4: ``wiring'' the ADC with the DAC, and measuring latencies (obsolete)}

\maketitle

\section{Description}

Let's start our understanding of InterCom with a simple program that
inputs digital audio (through the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter}{ADC}
of your computer) and, as soon as possible, outputs the audio (through
the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter}{DAC}). We
are going to use a minimal ``wiring'' program, that when it is run and
we feed back the audio output with the audio input of our computer,
allows us to measure the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)}{latency} of
this system. To handle the audio hardware we use
\href{https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io}{\texttt{sounddevice}}
\cite{sounddevice}, that is wrapper for the
\href{http://www.portaudio.com/}{PortAudio} library.

\section{What you have to do?}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
  
\item Download the Python
  \href{https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html}{module}
  \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/master/test/sounddevice/wire3.py}{wire3.py} with:

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo apt install curl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/master/test/sounddevice/wire3.py > wire3.py
  \end{lstlisting}      
      

\item 

\item OK, run the module with:




  %If you obtain the message \texttt{ALSA lib
  %  pcm.c:8526:(snd\_pcm\_recover) underrun occurred}, ignore it (this
  %is a consequence of that you are using
  %\href{https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/}{PulseAudio}
  %instead of \href{https://alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page}{ALSA}
  %directly, and the used \href{https://www.kernel.org/}{kernel} has
  %been compiled without
  %\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTLinux}{real-time process
  %  scheduling}).

\item Now, lets compute, experimentally, the latency experimented by
  \texttt{wire3.py}.


\section{Timming}

You should reach this milestone at most in one week.

\section{Deliverables}

Describe your experimental setup (CPU processor, RAM,
soundcard chipset, etc.), plot the data, and answer the question
enunciated in the Step ~\ref{question}.
