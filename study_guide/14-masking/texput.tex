\section{Description}

\subsection{Masking}
How much quantization noise can be generated without it being audible?
Psychoacoustics has the answer: A weaker signal (maskee signal) becomes
inaudible in the presence of (is masked by) a louder signal (masker signal). 

Masking depends on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The frequency of the maskee and the masker signals.
\item Their overlaping over time.
\end{enumerate}
