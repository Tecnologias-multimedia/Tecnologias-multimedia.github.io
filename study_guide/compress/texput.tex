\maketitle

\section{Description}

It's time to reduce bandwidth comsumption. The $\mathtt{pack()}$ and
the $\mathtt{unpack()}$ methods can compress and decompress,
respectively, the chunks that are handled. To compress and decompress,
we will use a free codec named
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE}{DEFLATE}, which is based
on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Storer%E2%80%93Szymanski}{LZSS}
and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding}{Huffman Coding}~\cite{nelson96datacompression}.

\section{What you have to do?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a class named \texttt{Compress}, that inherits from
  \texttt{Minimal} (the class implemented in the previous milestone),
  in which the methods $\mathtt{pack()}$ and $\mathtt{unpack()}$ are
  overriden to compress and decompress the chunks. Use the Python's
  standard library
  \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html}{\texttt{zlib}}. Store
  this class in a module named \texttt{compress.py}.
\item Compress (and decompress) each chunk as a unit (each compressed
  chunk will be transmitted in a different UDP packet). In order to
  increase slightly the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio}{(data)
    compression ratio}, reorder (re-sort) as:
\begin{pseudocode}{packing\_instructions\_before\_compression}{~}
  \PROCEDURE{Record\_IO\_and\_Play}{~}
  \BEGIN
    \mathtt{chunk} \GETS \mathtt{record()}\\
    \mathtt{packed\_chunk} \GETS \mathtt{pack(chunk)}\\
    \mathtt{send(packed\_chunk)}\\
    \mathtt{packed\_chunk} \GETS \mathtt{receive()}\\
    \mathtt{chunk} \GETS \mathtt{unpack(packed\_chunk)}\\
    \mathtt{play(chunk)}
  \END
  \ENDPROCEDURE
\end{pseudocode}

  the chunk data to put consecutive 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Timming}

Please, finish this milestone at most in one week.

\section{Deliverables}

The modules \texttt{intercom\_minimal\_zlib.py} and
\texttt{intercom\_inter\_zlib.py}. Store them at the
\href{https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom}{root
  directory} of your \texttt{intercom}'s repo.
