\maketitle

\section{Description}

Let's start our development of InterCom with a simple program that
inputs digital audio (through the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter}{ADC}
of your computer) and, as soon as possible, outputs it (through the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter}{DAC}). We
are going to use a minimal ``wiring'' program, that when it is run and
we feed back the audio output with the audio input of our computer,
allows us to measure
its \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)}{latency}. To
handle the audio hardware we use
\href{https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io}{\texttt{sounddevice}}
\cite{sounddevice}, that is wrapper for the
\href{http://www.portaudio.com/}{PortAudio} library.

\section{What you have to do?}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Refresh some (probably high-school) ideas about
  \href{https://vicente-gonzalez-ruiz.github.io/the_sound/}{The
    Sound}, \href{https://vicente-gonzalez-ruiz.github.io/human_auditory_system/}{The
    Human Auditory System},
    and \href{https://vicente-gonzalez-ruiz.github.io/human_sound_perception/}{The
    Human Sound Perception}. Notice that we are able to perceive
    sounds whose frequency ranges between 20 Hz and 20 KHz
    (approximately), and that a speaker is basically a microphone, and
    viceversa.
  
\item Download the Python
  \href{https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html}{module}
  \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/master/test/sounddevice/wire3.py}{wire3.py}. This module, basically:
  
  \begin{pseudocode}[display]{}{}
    \BEGIN
      \mathtt{CHUNK\_SIZE} \GETS 1024\\
      \WHILE \TRUE
      \BEGIN
        \mathtt{chunk} \GETS \mathtt{stream}.\mathtt{read}(\mathtt{CHUNK\_SIZE}) \STMTNUM{1in}{st.1}\\
        \mathtt{stream}.\mathtt{write}(\mathtt{chunk}) \STMTNUM{1.03in}{st.2}
      \END
    \END
  \end{pseudocode}

  where (1) captures $\mathtt{CHUNK\_SIZE}$ frames from the sound
  card, and (2) plays the chunk of frames
  $\mathtt{chunk}$. In \texttt{sounddevice} a frame is a collection of
  one or more samples (typically, a frame is a single sample if the
  number of channels is 1, or two samples if the number of channels is
  2).

\item If you want to run this module right now, check first that the
  output volumen of your speakers is not too high, otherwise you could
  ``couple'' the speaker and the mic(rophone) of your computer,
  producing a loud and annoying sound. In order to mitigate this
  effect, you can also control the record gain of your mic (if the
  gain is 0, no feedback between the speaker and the mic will be
  possible). In Xubuntu, these controls are available by clicking in
  the speaker icon (situated in the top right corner of your screen)
  of the XFCE window manager.

\item OK, run it, with:

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
    python wire3.py
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  althought probably you will obtain the error:
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
    nose
  \end{lstlisting}

  This is solved intalling the
  \href{https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{python-sounddevice}
  \cite{sounddevice} module with:

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
    pip install sounddevice
  \end{lstlisting}

\item Now, lets compute, experimentally, the \texttt{wire3.py}
  latency.

  \begin{enumerate} \item First, we will need the
  tools \href{http://sox.sourceforge.net/}{SoX}, \href{https://www.audacityteam.org/}{Audacity}
  and \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/master/test/sounddevice/wire3.py}{wire3.py}:
  
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
      sudo apt install sox
      sudo apt install audacity
      curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/master/test/sounddevice/plot_input.py > plot_input.py
    \end{lstlisting}

  \item Run:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
      python plot_input.py
    \end{lstlisting}

    and check that the gain of the mic does not
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)}{clip} the
    sound recording.

  \item Run:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
      sox -t alsa default test.wav
    \end{lstlisting}

    and in a different terminal, run:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
      python plot_input.py
    \end{lstlisting}

    while you control the output volume of the speakers to produce a
    decaying couple between both devices (the speaker(s) and the
    mic). If your desktop has not these
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer}{transducers}, we
    can use a
    \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=male+to+male+audio+jack+cable&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ALeKk00GZUDGqiOfc0D8xkA_MIYgCuZmSA:1600270049146&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdvsu-_u3rAhXl0eAKHS90DUoQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&biw=4288&bih=972}{male-to-male
      jack audio cable} and wire the input and the output of your
    sound card.

    
As you can see in the code of \texttt{wire3.py}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import sounddevice as sd
\end{lstlisting}

we are using the
 to access to the sound hardware.

Next, we create a I/O raw audio stream
using \href{https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/raw-streams.html#sounddevice.RawStream}{sounddevice.RawStream()},
using
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
stream = sd.RawStream(samplerate=44100, channels=2, dtype='int16')
\end{lstlisting}

As you can see in \cite{sounddevice}, this constructor method accepts
several parameters. In our example we have used only the most
relevants for us right now:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The samling rate.
\item The number of channels.
\item The number of bits of each sample.
\end{enumerate}
Please, refeer \cite{harmonic-analysis} for knowing more detailed
information about these parameters.

Please, review the modules of documentation 

Next, we define a chunk size
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
CHUNK_SIZE = 1024
\end{lstlisting}
for the block of data we are going to capture in the loop that will
be defined just below.

The loop is an infinite loop

\item Measure the theoretical latency.

\item Write a pulse generator that periodically plays a very short
  sound, and where we can control the period.

\item Capture this sound with \texttt{wire3.py} and modify the period
  until you hear that the input and the output are synchronized.

\item Compute the period in secods, this is also the latency of
  \texttt{wire3.py}.

\item Compute the difference between this latency and the theoretical
  one.

\end{enumerate}
