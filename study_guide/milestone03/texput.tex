\maketitle

\section{Description}

Let's start the development of InterCom with a simple program that
inputs digital audio (through
the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter}{ADC}
of our computer) and as soon as possible outputs it (through
the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter}{DAC}). You
can download an example program (which in the world of Python is
called a \emph{module})
from \href{https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/blob/master/test/sounddevice/wire3.py}{here}. If
you are planning to run this module right now, check first that the
output volumen of your speakers is not too high (an audio coupling (a
feedback) between the mic(rophone) and the speakers could happen).

As you can see in the code the module, we use the
\href{https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{python-sounddevice}
\cite{sounddevice} module to access to the sound hardware, through
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import sounddevice as sd
\end{lstlisting}

Next, we create a I/O raw audio stream
using \href{https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/raw-streams.html#sounddevice.RawStream}{sounddevice.RawStream()}, using
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
stream = sd.RawStream(samplerate=44100, channels=2, dtype='int16')
\end{lstlisting}

As you can see in \cite{sounddevice}, this constructor method accepts
several parameters. In our example we have used only the most
relevants for us right now:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The samling rate.
\item The number of channels.
\item The number of bits of each sample.
\end{enumerate}
Please, refeer \cite{harmonic-analysis} for knowing more detailed
information about these parameters.

Please, review the modules of documentation 

Next, we define a chunk size
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
CHUNK_SIZE = 1024
\end{lstlisting}
for the block of data we are going to capture in the loop that will
be defined just below.

The loop is an infinite loop
