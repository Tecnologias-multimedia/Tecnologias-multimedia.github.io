\section{Description}

\subsection{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapped_transform}{Overlapped transforms} for minimizing the distortion}
Transform coding implies to split the signal into chunks, and to
compute the transform of each chunk. When the output coefficients are
quantized, it is possible that significative (and unpleasant)
distortions may appear between the border samples of the chunks (see
this
\href{https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/blob/master/docs/quantization_DWT.ipynb}{notebook}).

One solution for the current ($i$-th) chunk is to use the last samples
of the previous ($i-1$-th) chunk and the first samples of the next
($i+1$-th) chunk for computing the transform of the current ($i$-th)
chunk. Therefore, to avoid signal discontinuities between chunks, we
can overlap them.
  
\section{What you have to do?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In a module named overlapped\_temporal\_decorrelate.py, inherit
  the class Temporal\_decorrelation and create a class named
  Overlapped\_temporal\_decorrelation.
\item Compare the RD (Rate/Distortion) curves with the previous one.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Timming}

Please, present your results in one week.

\section{Deliverables}

The module overlapped\_ttemporal\_decorrelate.py. Store it at the
\href{https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom}{root
  directory} of your InterCom's repo.

  The Figure~\ref{fig:transform_coding} shows the stages that are
  tipycally involved in a transform-based signal compression system.

  \caption{Common data-flow used un Transform Coding. $s$ represents
    the signal to compress, $\tilde{s}$ the lossy version of the
    reconstructed signal, $T$ the (forward) transform (which takes blocks of
    samples) producing blocks of coefficients $w$, $Q$ the scalar
    quantization stage (which takes single coefficients) producing
    quantization indexes $k$, $E$ the entropy encoder (which in our
    case (DEFLATE) works with blocks of coefficients) producing
    code-words $c$, $D$ the entropy decoder, $q$ the decuantization
    stage, and $t$ the inverse (or backward) transform. PCM stands for Puse Code
    Modulation and DEFLATE is the technique used to find a compact
    representation of the quantized coefficients.}
