\section{Description}

The InterCom project \cite{intercom} is a real-time application with
a high computational (specially in terms of CPU) demand. It is written
in Python \cite{Python}, an interpreted languaje that has been
ported \href{https://www.python.org/download/other/}{almost to all}
the current OS, including
mobile \href{https://kivy.org/#home}{devices}.

This milestone (the installation of a dedicated Linux distribution for
running InterCom) is optional , but I (as the teacher) highly
recommend to do it because I'll give technical support in a reasonable
time when you are in trouble. For this reason, I recommend you to run
InterCom in a Xubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) \cite{xubuntu} machine,
running natively
(no \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization}{virtualization}).

Therefore, the following ``guide'' helps you to install Xubuntu in an
external \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive}{USB
drive}, which must have at least 8GB of capacity (the minimal
installation of Xubuntu 20.04 needs about 5GB). You will need also a
temporal external USB disk with at leas 4GB to boot from it the
installation Xubuntu image (or to burn
an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc}{optical disk}).

\section{What do you have to do?}

Supposing that you have decided to use Xubuntu 20.04 in a USB disk,
these are the steps you should perform (to install Xubuntu in a disk
partition of your computer the instructions are almost the same):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download the
    installation \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_image}{image}
    from \href{https://xubuntu.org/download/}{here}.
    
  \item ``Burn'' the 4GB USB drive with the image. Depending on your
    current OS, use the following instructions
    for \href{https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview}{Windows}, \href{https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview}{OSX}, \href{https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview}{Ubuntu
    (and derivatives)},
    or \href{https://askubuntu.com/questions/372607/how-to-create-a-bootable-ubuntu-usb-flash-drive-from-terminal}{the
    console}.

\item Boot the image from the USB port. This step depends on your
  computer. Most of PCs can chose the boot device by pressing the
  F12-key when the PC is booting. On a Mac, you need to keep pressed
  the alt-key when it is booting.
  
\item Select the option \texttt{Try Xubuntu without installing}.
  
\item When the OS is running, configure the network.
  
\item Insert also the 8GB USB drive where Xubuntu will be installed.
  
\item Select \texttt{Install Xubuntu 20.04 LTS}.
  
\item Select English as the language used during the installation and the
  installed system. This will help in the case you need to search
  information in the Internet, providing the error descriptions in
  English.
  
\item Select your keyboard layout (probably \texttt{Spanish}).

\item Chose \texttt{Download updates while installing Xubuntu} and
  \texttt{Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware
    and additional media formats}, in order to have access to the
    ultimate software available for Ubuntu (and derivatives).

\item Chose \texttt{Erase disk and install Xubuntu}. Wait for a couple
  of minutes :-/

\item Select the drive corresponding to the 8GB USB drive. It's
  difficult to guess for me now the letter associated to this drive,
  but, it is very likely not \texttt{sda}.

\item At this point of the installation you should consider (depending
  on the amount of RAM memory installed in your computer and the size
  of the USB drive) to create an especific partition for doing
  swapping. The rule of the thumb is to create a partition with the
  same size that the RAM. However, probably you cannot do that in a
  8GB USB drive because at least 5GB are needed for a Xubuntu
  installation. Anyway, keep in mind that this step is optional
  because you can always perform swapping on a file (a process
  slightly slower than using the dedicated partition). Consider also
  that InterCom requires only some MB of memory for running and
  therefore, probably you are not going to need to swap
  any \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)}{memory
  page} at all.

\item Chose your time zone.
  
\item Configure you personal account, hostname and logging process.
  
\item Wait for the end of the installation and boot your new Xubuntu.
  
\end{enumerate}
