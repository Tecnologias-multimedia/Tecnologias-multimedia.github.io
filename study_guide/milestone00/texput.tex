\section{Description}

The InterCom project \cite{intercom} is a real-time application with
a high computational (specially in terms of CPU) demand. It is written
in Python \cite{Python}, an interpreted languaje that has been
ported \href{https://www.python.org/download/other/}{almost to all}
the current OS, including
mobile \href{https://kivy.org/#home}{devices}.

This is an optional milestone, but I (as the teacher) highly recommend
to do it because I'll give technical support in a reasonable time when
you are in trouble. For this reason, I recommend you to run InterCom
in a Xubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) \cite{xubuntu} machine, running
natively
(no \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization}{virtualization}).

Therefore, the following ``guide'' install Xubuntu in an
external \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive}{USB
drive}, which must have at least 8GB of capacity (the minimal
installation of Xubuntu 20.04 need about 5GB). You will need also a
temporal external USB disk with at leas 4GB to boot from it the
installation Xubuntu image (or burn
an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc}{optical disk}).

\section{What do you have to do?}

Supposing that you have decided to use Xubuntu 20.04, these are the
steps you should perform:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download the installation image from
    \href{https://xubuntu.org/download/}{here}.
    
  \item ``Burn'' the 4GB-drive/disk drive with the
    image. Depending on your current OS, use the following
    instructions for
    \href{https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview}{Windows},
    \href{https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview}{OSX},
    or
    \href{https://askubuntu.com/questions/372607/how-to-create-a-bootable-ubuntu-usb-flash-drive-from-terminal}{Linux and OSX}.

\item Boot the installer from the USB port. This step depends on your
  computer. Most of PCs can chose the boot device by pressing the
  F12-key when the PC is booting. On a Mac, you need to keep pressed
  the alt-key when it is booting.
  
\item Select the option \texttt{Try Xubuntu without installing}.
  
\item When the OS is running, configure the network.
  
\item Insert also the 8GB USB drive where Xubuntu will be installed.
  
\item Select \texttt{Install Xubuntu 20.04 LTS}.
  
\item Select English as the language used during the install and the
  installed system. This will help in the case you need to search
  information in the Internet, providing the error descriptions in
  English.
  
\item Select your keyboard layout (probably \texttt{Spanish}).

\item Chose \texttt{Download updates while installing Xubuntu} and
  \texttt{Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware
    and additional media formats}.

\item Chose \texttt{Erase disk and install Xubuntu}. Wait for a couple
  of minutes :-/

\item Select the drive corresponding to the 8GB USB drive. It's
  difficult to guess for me now the letter associated to this drive,
  but, it is very likely not \texttt{sda}.

\item At this point of the installation you should consider (depending
  on the amount of RAM memory in your computer and the size of the USB
  drive) to create an especific partition for doing swapping. The rule
  of the thumb is to create a partition with the same size that the
  installed RAM. However, probably you cannot do that in a 8GB USB
  drive because at least 5GB are needed for a Xubuntu
  installation. Anyway, keep in mind that this step is optional
  because you can always perform swapping on a file (a process
  slightly slower than using the dedicated partition). Consider also
  tha InterCom requires only some MB of memory for running and
  therefore, probably you are not going to perform swapping.

\item Chose your time zone.
  
\item Configure you personal account, hostname and logging process.
  
\item Wait for the end of the installation and boot your new Xubuntu.
  
\item Go to
  \href{https://github.com/vicente-gonzalez-ruiz/YAPT/blob/master/01-hello_world/02-installation.ipynb}{YAPT/01-hello\_world/02-installation.ipynb}
  \cite{YAPY} and follow the instructions to install CPython 3.8.5.
\item Following also these instructions, create a new virtual
  environment called \texttt{tm}.
\item Remember that you will need to active it when you want to work
  in this project. It is a good idea to append:
  \lstlisting{language=Bash}{
    pyenv activate tm
  }
  to the \texttt{~/.bashrc} file.
\item Install an IDE for programming with Python. I recommend Thonny.
\end{enumerate}
