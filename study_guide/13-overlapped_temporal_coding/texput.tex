\section{Description}

\subsection{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapped_transform}{Overlapped block transforms} for minimizing the distortion}
Transform coding implies to split the signal into blocks of data
(chunks), and to compute the transform of each chunk. When the output
coefficients are quantized, it is possible that significative (and
unpleasant) distortions may appear between the border frames of the
chunks (see the Fig~\ref{fig:3_chunks}). This is a consequence of that
in the prediction step used by the DWT in the limits of the chunks
generate different predictions at both sides of the border.

One solution to avoid signal discontinuitites between chunks is to
overlap the chunks. Thus, the current ($i$-th) chunk uses also the
last frames of the previous ($(i-1)$-th) chunk and the first frames of
the next ($(i+1)$-th) chunk to compute the transform of the current
extended ($i$-th) chunk (see the Fig.~\ref{fig:subbands}). This has
been described in the following algorithm:

\subsection*{Encoder:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $C_{-1}=0$.
\item Input $C_1$.
\item For $i\in\{1,2,\cdots\}$:   
  \begin{enumerate}               
  \item Input chunk $C_{i+1}$.
  \item Compute decomposition $D_i \leftarrow
    \text{DWT}^l(C_{i-1}[-o:]|C_i|C_{i+1}[:o])$, where $D_i$ is the
    decomposition of the $i$-th extended chunk, $\cdot|\cdot$ denotes
    the concatenation-of-frames operator, defined by
    \begin{equation}
      a|b = \{a,b\},
    \end{equation}
    and $C_{i-1}[-o:]|C_i|C_{i+1}[:o]$ is the $i$-th extended chunk
    (see Fig.~\ref{fig:subbands}), where $o$ is the overlapped area
    size in frames, $C[:o]$ are the first $o$ frames of the chunk $C$,
    $C[-o:]$ its last $o$ frames, and $l$ is the number of levels of
    the DWT ($l=2$ in the Fig.~\ref{fig:subbands}).
  \item Send decomposition $D_i$.
  \item $C_{i-1}\leftarrow C_i$.
  \item $C_i\leftarrow C_{i+1}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Notice that we are sending for each chunk $2o+x$ stereo-coefficients, where
$x$ is the number of frames/chunk.

\subsection*{Decoder:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For $i\in\{0,1,\cdots\}$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Receive decomposition $D_i$.
  \item Compute extended chunk $C_i\leftarrow\text{DWT}^{-l}(D_i)$.
  \item Output chunk $C_i[o:-o]$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

    $l=2$. $o$ is the number of frames to overlap between adajacent
    chunks. $C[:o]$ represents the first $o$ framees of the chunk $C$
    and $C[-o:]$ the last $x-o$ frames of chunk C, where $x$ is the
    number of frames in $C$.}
  \label{fig:subbands}
\end{figure}

This idea has been implemented in this
\href{https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/blob/master/docs/overlapped_DWT_I.ipynb}{notebook},
and the result can be seen in the Fig.~\ref{fig:3_chunks}.

\subsection{Reducing the data overhead}

Unfortunately, the previous algorithm sends twice the DWT coefficients
of the overlapped areas (in the Fig.~\ref{fig:subbands},
$\{C_{i-1}[-o:].L^2, C_{i+1}[:o].L^2, C_{i-1}[-o:].H^2,
C_{i+1}[:o].H^2, C_{i-1}[-o:].H^1, C_{i+1}[:o].H^1\}$). To avoid this
waste of bandwidth, we can reuse the received coefficients of the
overlapped areas. This procedure has been described in the
Fig.~\ref{fig:overlapping}. As it can be seen, the encoding algorithm
is identical to the previous one except in that only the central
(stereo) coefficients are sent. The rest of coefficients that are
needed to compute the inverse transform are extracted from the
neighbor chunks (represented in the DWT domain). Notice that now, the
number of sent coefficients is $x$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \svg{graphics/overlapping}{800}
  \caption{Block overlapping in the DWT domain for $l=2$. Only the
    shady coefficients are transmitted.}
  \label{fig:overlapping}
\end{figure}

%\subsection*{Encoder:}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item For $i\in\{0,1,\cdots\}$:
%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Input $C_i$ and $C_{i+1}$.
%  \item $D_i \leftarrow \text{DWT}(C_i[o:]|C_{i+1}[:o])$, where
%    $C[o:]$ the last $x-o$ frames of the chunk $C$, and
%    $C_i[o:]|C_{i+1}[:o]$ is the $i$-th right-only extended chunk.
%    \item Send $D_i$.
%  \end{enumerate}
%\end{enumerate}

The codec now can be described by:

\subsection*{Encoder:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For $i\in\{0,1,\cdots\}$:   
  \begin{enumerate}               
  \item Input chunk $C_i$.
  \item Compute decomposition $D_i \leftarrow \text{DWT}^l(C_i)$.
  \item Send $D_i$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Decoder:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $D_{-1}=0$.
\item Input decomposition $D_1$.
\item For $i\in\{1,2,\cdots\}$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Receive decomposition $D_{i+1}$.
  \item Build extended decomposition ($l=2$) $E_i =
    D_{i-1}[-o:].L^2|D_i.L^2|D_{i+1}[:0].L^2|D_{i-1}[-o:].H^2|D_i.H^2|D_{i+1}[:0].H^2|D_{i-1}[-o:].H^1|D_i.H^1|D_{i+1}[:0].H^1$.
  \item Compute extended chunk $C_i\leftarrow\text{DWT}^{-l}(E_i)$.
  \item Output $C_i[o:-o]$.
  \item $D_{i-1} \leftarrow D_i$.
  \item $D_i \leftarrow D_{i+1}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

%Notice that the only that changes between this codec and the previous
%one is that now, the inverse transform of the extended chunks uses the
%last coefficients of the previous extended chunk. This idea has been
%checked in the
%\href{https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom/blob/master/docs/overlapped_DWT_II.ipynb}{notebook}.
