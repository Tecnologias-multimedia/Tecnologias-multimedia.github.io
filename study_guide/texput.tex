\section{Introduction}
TM follows the PBL (Project-Based Learning) methodology. The students,
helped by the teacher, develop a project during the course. This
project
is \href{https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom}{InterCom}(municator),
an application that allows us to communicate networked users throught
the Internet.

The project is implemented as a sequence of milestones. The students,
in groups of up to 4 people, propose solutions for each
milestone. Such solutions are presented to the rest of the class by
each group, and each group gives and receives a score and feedback
from the rest of the class and also from the teacher.
