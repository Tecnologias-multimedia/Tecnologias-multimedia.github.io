\section{Scope}

Tecnologías Multimedia (TM) is an optative subject of the Computer
Science Degree at the UAL (University of Almería). Currently, TM is
focused on the development of real-time audio processing techniques,
specifically, encoding and transmission.

\section{Main goals}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ability to understand the environment of an organization and its
  needs in the field of information technologies and communications,
  in real time
  (\href{https://www.ual.es/application/files/8516/5061/5446/memoriavig-ing-informatica-4015.pdf}{TI1}).
\item Ability to conceive systems, applications and services based on
  network technologies, including Internet, web, e-commerce,
  multimedia, interactive services and mobile computing
  (\href{https://www.ual.es/application/files/8516/5061/5446/memoriavig-ing-informatica-4015.pdf}{TI6}).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology and Contents}
TM follows the PBL (Project-Based Learning)
\href{http://portafirma.ual.es/pfirma/downloadReport/file?idDocument=4u61Ie5es2&idRequest=ZeBY35LlFa}{methodology}. The
students, helped by the lecturer, develop a project during the
classes. This project is
\href{https://github.com/Tecnologias-multimedia/intercom}{InterCom}(municator),
a Python application that allows networked users to communicate, in
real-time, throught the Internet.

The project is developed as a sequence of milestones. The students, in
groups of up to 4 people, propose solutions for each milestone. Such
solutions are presented to the rest of the class, and each group gives
and receives a feedback from the rest of the class and also from the
lecturer. The best solutions are incorporated to the project, with the
objective of improve it.

The contents of the subject can be found \href{https://tecnologias-multimedia.github.io/contents/}{here}.

\section{Attendance}
Currently,
\href{https://www.ual.es/estudios/grados/presentacion/plandeestudios/asignatura/4015/40154321}{the
  course is organized in 14 lectures of 2 hours/lecture, and 14
  practicals of 2 hours/practice, during 7 weeks (approx.)}, and it
has been developed to be a virtual and blended training. This means
that all the content is available online, but students are expected to
regularly attend the sessions, which are mainly practical.

\section{Grading Policy}
